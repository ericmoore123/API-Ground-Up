*A NodeJS installation of v16^ required. Post man strongly recommended*

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ericmoore123/mocha-testing-js.git
$ npm i

*Verify dependencies after install.*

### Running Express API
API code and utilities are held under root directory and */utils* respectively.

```
Server port declared as value held within a .env file but explicitly defined as port:8800 (fallback) by default.
